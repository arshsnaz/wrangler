ðŸš€ New Feature: Support for Byte Size & Time Duration Units
As part of this enhancement, Wrangler now supports parsing and aggregating Byte Size and Time Duration units directly within recipes.

âœ… Supported Units
Unit Type	Examples	Canonical Unit
Byte Size	10KB, 1.5MB, 2GB	Bytes
Time Duration	150ms, 2s, 1.5min	Milliseconds
ðŸ§  How It Works
Two new token types have been added:

BYTE_SIZE â†’ Parsed using ByteSize.java

TIME_DURATION â†’ Parsed using TimeDuration.java

These can be used in directives as arguments and are automatically converted to bytes or milliseconds for computation.

ðŸ†• New Directive: aggregate-stats
This directive performs aggregation over byte sizes and time durations.

ðŸ”§ Syntax:
text
Copy code
aggregate-stats :<size_column> :<time_column> <output_size_column> <output_time_column>
âœ… Example:
text
Copy code
aggregate-stats :data_transfer :response_time total_size_mb total_time_sec
ðŸ“Š Input Data (example rows):
data_transfer	response_time
1MB	1s
512KB	500ms
ðŸ“¤ Output:
total_size_mb	total_time_sec
1.5	1.5
ðŸ§ª Testing & AI Usage
Tests are written for both the parser classes and the directive.

AI tooling (ChatGPT) was used for:

Grammar writing

Directive scaffolding

Unit test generation
